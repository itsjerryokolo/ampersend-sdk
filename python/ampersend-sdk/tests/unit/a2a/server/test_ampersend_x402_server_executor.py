"""Unit tests for AmpersendX402ServerExecutor.

Verifies that the executor:
  - Calls Ampersend's authorize-receipt endpoint with the right
    fields extracted from the payment payload.
  - On compliance allow, delegates to the facilitator's verify_payment.
  - On compliance deny, returns VerifyResponse(is_valid=False) with
    a deliberately generic invalid_reason and never calls the
    facilitator. The full deny detail (reason, code, screening_id)
    must NOT leak to the client — server-side audit only.
  - On compliance API error / timeout, the exception propagates so
    the upstream task layer 500s. Translating to a structured deny
    would silently swallow outages.
  - Settle is unchanged — always goes straight to the facilitator
    (a settlement for a payment that compliance already allowed).

These tests reach into `executor._facilitator` (a private attr on
the parent `FacilitatorX402ServerExecutor`) to mock the facilitator
client without standing up a real one. If the parent class renames
that attribute, these tests will hard-fail — accept the brittleness
in exchange for not restructuring the parent for testability.
